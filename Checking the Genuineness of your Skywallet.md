# Checking the Genuineness of your Skywallet

## Checking your Skywallet Package for Tampering

Once you receive the Skywallet shipment, please check for any physical tampering or damage to the package of any sort.

Tampering or damage can be anything from a small tear on the package to a package that is torn open.

**Do not accept a shipment which seems to be damaged in any such way.**

### An Untampered Shipment:

## Checking the Firmware

The Skywallet is built to provide maximum security to the user.

However, it is vital to check that your Skywallet is not compromised before using it.

## Step 1 - Connecting Your Skywallet

First, connect the Skywallet to your USB port.

## Step 2 - Checking the message on your Skywallet's Display

The display on your Skywallet shows one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking the authenticity of your Skywallet.

### Scenario 1:

If the Skywallet is a genuine one and is being used for the first time, then the screen will display the following message:

**Welcome!**

**Please visit skycoin.net** 

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

A Skywallet that is being used for the first time will not have a firmware installed.

Firmware is like the brain of a hardware device (in this case, your Skywallet). It is the software interface which helps the hardware to interact with both the user as well as a computer. Thus without a firmware, your Skywallet will not work correctly.

Hence any message apart from this welcome message implies that your Skywallet has been tampered with by a third party. Thus if you get any message apart from the welcome message, proceed to disconnect the device and contact support immediately.

### Scenario 2:

A previously used Skywallet may have a firmware initialized, and if it has, then it might mean that it has been manipulated. Such a Skywallet will display the following message on its display screen:

**Need Seed!**

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

If you get a "Need Seed!" message on your first use, it means that your Skywallet is not a new one and has a firmware already initialized.

**Note - If you do get a Need Seed! message on your first use of the Skywallet, refrain from using the device.**

### Scenario 3:

The third and final message that might be displayed is a warning:

**Unofficial Firmware Detected**

such a message denote that the Skywallet is running on a firmware that is not approved by Skycoin. 

Do **not** use a Skywallet displaying that warning as the software version on your Skywallet might be corrupted, and it is ***unsafe*** to use the Skywallet, as using the said Skywallet could potentially make you lose your coins.
