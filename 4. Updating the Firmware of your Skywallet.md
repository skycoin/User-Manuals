# Updating the Firmware of your Skywallet

The firmware of your Skywallet is its user interface. A brand new Skywallet will not have a firmware installed.

Hence the first thing you have to do when you receive your Skywallet is to install the firmware. Once installed, the firmware of your Skywallet also needs periodic updates.

It is essential you do these updates; otherwise, you would not benefit from the latest security features and upgrades, ultimately putting your coins under risk of security threats.  
Also, at times, the firmware updates are made to improve the functionality of your Skywallet.

## Knowing when to Update:

The Skywallet is designed to store your coins on a long term basis. However, it is essential to connect your Skywallet periodically to check for an available firmware update.

To check this, you can connect your Skywallet to your computer and open the Hardware Wallet window from the Desktop Wallet.

If your firmware is an outdated version then the following warning message will be displayed:

If you ignore this dialogue box, the warning message will continue to be displayed in the next window.

## Updating your Firmware:

**Warning - Before you start updating your firmware, ensure that you have backed up the Seed of your Skywallet. It is vital that you have the backup of the Seed because once the update is complete, you will need the Seed to restore your coins.**

***If you need assistance on how to backup the Seed, visit the following link - [Personalization of your Skywallet](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Getting-to-know-the-wallet).***

Once you have completed the backup of your Seed, you can proceed to update the firmware.

You can begin by clicking on the **Update** button from the dialogue box which appears right after you connect your Skywallet to the computer.

If you have ignored this message and are in the Hardware Wallet option window, you can click on the **Update Firmware** button.

Once you have clicked on either the "Update" button or "Update Firmware" button, a dialogue box with the warning message to **Backup your Seed** will appear on your computer:

The warning message will also ask you to connect your Skywallet in bootloader mode.

To connect your Skywallet in bootloader mode, you have to follow these steps:

**Step 1 - Disconnect your Skywallet from the computer.**

**Step 2 - Reconnect the Skywallet while simultaneously pressing both the physical buttons on the Skywallet.**

When connected in the bootloader mode, the display screen on your Skywallet shows the following:

To continue the update you have to accept the operation on your computer. 

The update process will be completed within a few seconds.

**Note - If the update process gets abruptly terminated for any reasons, you can disconnect the Skywallet, close the Desktop Wallet and then restart the whole process from the start.**
