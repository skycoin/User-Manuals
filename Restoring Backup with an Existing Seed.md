# Restoring Backup with an Existing Seed

If you have bought a brand new Skywallet and wish to restore the backup of another Skywallet, then you can utilize the "Restore Backup" option during the initialization of your Skywallet.

To restore your coins, you only need the Seed of the other Skywallet.

***A Seed is a combination of 12 or 24 words which serves as the key to access your Skywallet.***

**NOTE - You can use the Seed of a Skywallet on another Skywallet, but it is not recommended to use the same Seed for a Desktop Wallet, as this could comprise the security of your Skywallet.**

To begin the restoration process follow these steps:

### Step 1 

Connect the new Skywallet to your computer.

### Step 2

Once the Skywallet is connected, you will see a welcome message on its display, which also denotes the genuineness of your Skywallet. 

If you want to know more how to check the genuineness of your Skywallet. Please visit the following link - [Checking the Genuineness of your Skywallet](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/How-to-check-whether-device-is-genuine)

### Step 3

After connecting the Skywallet to your computer, you can proceed to open your Desktop Wallet.

If you do not have the latest version of the Desktop Wallet, then please download the same from the [Downloads](https://www.skycoin.net/downloads/) page.

If it is your first-time use of the Desktop Wallet, then the following window will be displayed:

Proceed to click on the **Using a hardware wallet?** button.

If it is not your first-time use of the Desktop Wallet, then all the Wallets configured using your Desktop Wallet will appear in a list.

In this case, proceed to click on the **Hardware Wallet** button, at the bottom.

### Step 4

Once you have clicked either "Using a hardware wallet?" button or "Hardware Wallet" button, the following window will be displayed by your Desktop Wallet.

Proceed to click on the **Restore backup** button.

Upon clicking "Restore backup" button, the Skywallet will start asking you to enter each words of your Seed by their position.

**The sequence of these positions will be random, i.e., the first word asked to be entered might be the word at position #6, but the next word might be the word at position #11 and so on.**

**The Skywallet might also ask you to enter random words that are not part of your Seed as well.**

**The random sequence of words and the random words are a security precaution and because of this security measures it can be ensured that a potential hacker/malware, who has access to your computer does get neither the full Seed nor right sequence of the Seed.**

If you have successfully entered both the random words and the words in your Seed according to their position, the Desktop Wallet will display a confirmation window that your new Skywallet was added to the Wallet list.

You can also rename your Skywallet using this window.

However, if you fail to enter either the random words correctly, or incorrectly enter the words of your Seed, the process will fail, and you will have to restart the procedure from the beginning.
