# Initializing your Skywallet

On successfully ensuring the genuineness of your Skywallet, you can begin with the initialization of it.

## Step 1 :

The first step in initializing your Skywallet is to install the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

As the Skycoin Desktop Wallet is used for the interaction between the Skywallet and the User.

Please make sure to download the latest compatible version from the Skycoin [Downloads](https://www.skycoin.net/downloads/) Page.

The portable and mobile version of the wallet is **not** compatible with the Skywallet.

<If you are a Linux user then please make sure to run this script>

## Step 2:

Connect your Skywallet to the USB port.

## Step 3:

Once you have connected the Skywallet to the USB port, open the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

The instructions for a desktop wallet which is used for the first time and an already configured desktop wallet are different.

### Step 3.1: First Time Use of a Desktop Wallet

If it is for the first time you are using the desktop wallet then you will see the following screen :

In this window you can select two options :

**Configure automatically**

**Restore backup**

### Step 4.1: Configure automatically

If you are using a Skywallet for the **first** time, then you can proceed with the option of Configure Automatically.

"Configure automatically" button will configure your Skywallet as a new one entirely.

Once the configuration is complete, the following window will be displayed.

### Step 4.2: Restore backup

If you have already used a Wallet to store Skycoins and has the backup of the same with you, then you can opt for Restore Backup option.

The restoration process is explained in detail in this section - [Restore Configuration](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Restore-configuration)


If the Skywallet is **not** connected then the following error message will be displayed:
