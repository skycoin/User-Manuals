# Setting up your Desktop Wallet

Once you are done with the installation of your Desktop Wallet on your computer, you can start initializing it.

After installation, the Desktop Wallet will take some time to sync the Blockchain of Skycoin up until the latest block.

The progress of the syncing process will be displayed on the home screen of the Desktop Wallet.

## Wallet Creation

Once the syncing is complete, you can begin the initialization by creating a new Wallet:

**Step 1** - Click on the button **Add Wallet**.

**Step 2** - A dialogue box will appear with the following details :

* A blank box to enter the name of the Wallet - any name you wish to give your Wallet.

* Seed of the Wallet - The Seed is the key component of a Wallet; hence it should be kept in a safe place to secure it from unauthorized access.  
The recommended way to store your Seed is by writing down the Seed in a piece of paper and storing it safely.  
By default, a 12 word Seed will be generated. However, you can opt for a 24 word Seed by click on the button **24 words**.  
You can read more on the security precautions when handling Seed in this chapter - [Securing and Accessing your Seed]().

* A blank box to confirm the Seed of the Wallet - The Seed generated needs to be entered in this box to confirm the action.

* Encrypt Wallet - By default, the **Encrypt Wallet** box will be checked.  
The "Encrypt Wallet" option adds a password to your Desktop  Wallet to improve its security.  
Although not recommended, you can also opt to uncheck the option and leave your Desktop Wallet without a password.

* Password - If the "Encrypt Wallet" checkbox is ticked then you have to enter a password and confirm the same to encrypt your Desktop Wallet. 

**Step 3** - Once you are done entering all the details, you can proceed to create the Desktop Wallet by clicking on the **Create** button.

## Multiple Wallet and Address Creations

Your Desktop Wallet supports the creation of multiple Wallets and addresses.

To create a new Wallet, you can click on the "Add Wallet" button and follow the same steps as in the creation of your first Wallet.

To add new addresses to your existing Wallet, you can click on the drop-down arrow and then click on the **New Addresses** button.

A dialogue box will appear to confirm the number of addresses that needs to be created. You can create a maximum of 100 addresses.

Once created, the new addresses will be displayed below the existing addresses of your Wallet.
